I know we just learned this material recently, and I don't want it to seem like I'm only writing about Snetiment-Analysis for that reason, but I truly
do think this was one of the coolest concepts & areas I've explored in any class during my past few years at Babson. I found it to be an 
incredibly enriching & educationally rewarding assignment & experience, particularly because I'm an extremely avid reddit user, and I'll probably
spend anywhere from 1-2 hours a day on the site. I use it for virtually everything, from entertainment & music, to news & deeper discussions. And 
as you're aware, given that you too love the platform & build your own bots, Reddit loves for community members to build their own apps & bots for the
site, and though I've always seen them around, responding to my comments or auto-moderating, I've never actually given much though to thm.
I even had the opportunity to create a Reddit app & utilize their API. I had some difficulty with my initial setup process, especially with Praw, but 
I managed to work through it eventually, and figured out my mistakes. For this particular situation I used Sentiment Analysis as my primary technique, a
decision centered on the fact that this particular subreddit is exploding with activity due to a huge trade that just went down, and is sure to have
wide-reaching implications. I hoped to learn about the general sentiment of the subreddit regarding the trade, & see how they were processing it. And 
honestly, I can say that I achieved my goals. I found that the subreddit had generally negative feelings for the player who had forced his way 
out of his team & was badmouthing them to the media, which makes sense, and even though my project's scope was miniscule, I still felt like I had
achieved something very tangible. I loved that you gave us a very open ended assignment here, and had us go out and figure out the processes & the
steps ourselves. You gave us some great resources, but being challenged to learn on my own made it much more informative & will probably help 
keep all the information rooted in my brain. Overall, this was a highly informative & educationally rewarding assignment. I learned an incredible 
amount about text-mining & sentiment analysis, and it was actually not as difficult as I originally believed.
